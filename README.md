# Schoodle
Inspired by doodle.com, Schoodle facilitates the process of organizing meetings with multiple peoples, and finding a suitable time for everyone. 
Users can create events with multiple potential timeframes and send it out to participants. 
Participants can then select which timeframe is best suited for them. Event organizers can use this information to schedule an event when everyone is available.
